<ol>
<li><p>Please do not troll or spam in the chat. Examples include trying to spam a certain link (advertisement) / logs, or just acting cancerrous towards the chat.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not ask for rank, whether you are a regular user, Voice, or even staff. Failure to following this rule will lead to a warn/mute, as well as the chances of ever getting promoted to go low. For staff, you will be demoted if you constantly are begging for rank (that shows that you are power-hungry).</p></li>
<li><p>For staff, do not abuse your powers, like muting and banning users for no reason. Failure in following this rule will lead to a demotion from the rank and potentially no chance of ever getting the rank back.</p></li>
<li><p>Always listen to a staff member if they ask you to stop a specific discussion, or any related causes. Failure to do so will lead to a mute.</p></li>
<li><p>Please... do not cause any drama in the chat. If you are caught doing this, you will be either muted or banned from the room.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not be disrespectful to new users. If a new user joins the chat, it is a good duty to welcome him and make him feel comfortable in this private room. Failure to not only respecting users, but scaring off other users that leads to them leaving the room, will lead to a mute (a roomban if problem becomes worse).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It would also be recommended to read over the <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/rules">Pokemon Showdown rules</a> and follow them as well to be a nice and helpful presence in Hydrocity.</p>
